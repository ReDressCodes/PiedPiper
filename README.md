This is supposed to be some atrocious junk that is supposed to attempt to pipe emails through duck.com mailer from gmail.

It is quite clear that gmail sometimes strips identifying information from emails when sending them to certain emails. This is happening with my duck.com email too.

This is ridiculously nasty and this should be an attempt to get around this issue.
